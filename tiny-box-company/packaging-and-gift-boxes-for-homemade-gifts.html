	<h1>Packaging and Gift Boxes for Homemade Gifts</h1>
	<p>As someone who has made jewellery by hand for a good number of years now, I fully understand and appreciate the benefits to choosing packaging for your creations which shows them off to their best advantage. When you've spent a good number of hours or even days on a single piece of work, it can be disappointing to find that others, particularly your customers, are not quite seeing the value in the piece.</p>
	<p>It might sound silly and trivial,but the way you choose to package and present your handmade gifts can make them look and feel even more special and luxurious to the person receiving them. Whether you are making things to give to friends and family, or operate a business and sell your wares, you will certainly notice a difference in the way your crafts are perceived once you get the packaging spot on.</p>
	<h2>Match the packaging to your style</h2>
	<p>Some of my best advice when it comes to packaging and presenting handmade items is to work with the personality of each piece and look for inspiration in popular current trends. Instagram is a great place to look for gorgeous colour schemes and high end, designer looks that you can replicate for your own gifts. If, for example, you produce <a href="https://www.tinyboxcompany.co.uk/tiny-marketplace/handmade-jewellery"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>handmade jewellery</strong></em></span></a> that sparkes, try presenting it in plain, colour-block style gift boxes so that the jewellery steals the show when it catches the light.</p>
	<p>For items that are a little more subtle, soft complementary colours can be used to give the gift a more impactful reveal. Jewellery and gifts that have a more organic look and feel should be matched with packaging that has similar colours and textures, so as to not overshine the craftsmanship of the piece. These basic principles can be applied to your unique handmade gifts so that they always look beautifully and professionally presented.</p>
	<h2>Which type of gift packaging is best?</h2>
	<p>There are a huge number of gift packaging options available, and these can be found online or on the high street, though for obvious reasons you are likely to find much more choice online. When choosing the kind of packaging you might like to use there are no right or wrong choices, and even the guidance above is only that, guidance. Ultimately you will know your target market better than anyone, and are likely to have a clearer understanding of what kind of packaging is likely to help your items to catch their eye.</p>
	<p>Gift boxes are extremely popular among crafters selling their goods online and in physical stores. They are a must when packaging small and delicate items such as <a href="https://www.tinyboxcompany.co.uk/tiny-marketplace/handmade-jewellery/earrings"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>handmade earrings</strong></em></span></a> which are unsuitable for other kinds of packaging like gift bags. They are also ideal for larger goods and can be purchased in a range of sizes, shapes, colours and designs to suit, many stores also offer discounts and wholesale prices for those in the trade which can help you to keep costs down.</p>
	<p>Gift bags are great for unusually shaped things like homewares and textiles, and you can even find food-grade gift bags that are perfect for safely and attractively storing food items such as homemade sweets, brownies and biscuits. Gift bags and boxes are both great choices as they give a professional touch while also protecting the item inside. Boxes with added padding material such as tissue paper remain the best option for very delicate, fragile items as they are relatively sturdy and help guarantee that your handmade gifts arrive safely.</p> <span style="display: block; text-align: center; clear: both;"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_GkDAKinu8?modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
	<h3>Making eco-friendly packaging choices</h3>
	<p>A trend among retailers is to give their customers more eco-friendly choices when it comes to gifting. From fair trade and eco cosmetics and toiletries, to ethically produced jewellery and sustainable luxury foods and more, many of us are looking for ways to become more ethical consumers. This extends to the packaging we choose - a cardboard rather than plastic based box for your <a href="https://www.tinyboxcompany.co.uk/tiny-marketplace/handmade-jewellery/necklaces"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>handmade necklace</strong></em></span></a>, for example, might be the perfect thing to sway a potential customer looking to shop with their conscience. Opting for packaging that is sturdy enough to last should the recipient decide to reuse it, or can easily be recycled is a consideration that is becoming ever more important.</p>
