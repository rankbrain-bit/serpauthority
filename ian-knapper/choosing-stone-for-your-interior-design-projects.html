	<h1>Choosing Stone for Your Interior Design Projects</h1>
	<p>Stone has long been considered one of the most luxurious building materials when it comes to interior architecture design. It oozes effortless confidence and class when used to furnish interiors, and is highly valued for its ability to withstand the test of time. For centuries, stone interior architecture has been used to create some of the most impressive architecture examples, many of which are important historical sites to this day.</p>
	<p>Stone can be used very effectively to elevate interior design and to create a dramatic look. Some of the most iconic interior design choices involve the use of stone, such as elegant mezzanine floors, grand sweeping staircases, luxurious marble cladding, and other design choices which act as status symbols. There are an almost unlimited number of ways that stone interior architecture can be incorporated into a space to give it an impactful look.</p>
	<p>The types of stone used in interior design are diverse and each is suited to a range of different applications such as creating elegant <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.ianknapper.com/stone-staircases/">stone staircases</a></strong></em></span>. Choosing the perfect stone to elevate a space can be a difficult decision for interior designers to make as there are so many which are commercially available and each has its own unique personality.</p>

	<h2>Which types of stone are best for interiors</h2>
	<p>There are three kinds of stone which exist on Earth, and they are igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks, and metamorphic stone. The reason they are so different is because they are formed in very different ways, and there can even be a huge amount of variation between stones of the same kind, due to external factors present when the stone was formed such as localised mineral content.</p>
	<p>Igneous rock comes into being when volcanic action produces molten rock which is then allowed to cool and solidify. Igneous rocks tend to have a dark and glossy appearance due to the small and tightly packed crystals which make up its structure. It is incredibly dense and tough, making it an excellent choice for load bearing surfaces such as floor tiles.</p>
	<p>Metamorphic rock is the name given to any kind of rock which has undergone changes which have altered its structure and appearance. One of the most commonly used metamorphic rocks used in interior design is marble, known for its creamy appearance and beautiful veining. Marble started out as a completely different kind of rock which has undergone immense pressures and temperatures as well as molten mineral solutions which completely alter its structure and create the vast and intricate patterns which thread through entire beds of marble.</p>
	<p>Marble is known to be an easy material to take care of, and so it is often used in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.ianknapper.com/6-natural-stone-interior-design-tips/">stone interior design</a></strong></em></span>. It is a popular choice for bathrooms, kitchens, floors, and staircases, as well as any other features which need to be long lasting and retain an impressive look for many years with minimal upkeep.</p>
	<p>Limestone is perhaps the most well known sedimentary rock and it, like other sedimentary rocks, is created when sandy deposits are placed under immense pressures which compress them and fuse their particles together. Other examples of sedimentary rocks include sandstone, travertine, and breccia. Sedimentary rocks will usually take on the colour of the deposits they are made from, and so are usually a pale grey in colour, though they can range from burnt orange to pale yellow or dark grey and beige.</p>
	<p>Travertine is a very popular sedimentary rock which is used often in interior design. Most cuts of travertine feature a highly attractive veining pattern throughout, and some pieces are more heavily patterned than others. A skilled interior designer working with stone will be able to select pieces of travertine for your interior design which are similarly patterned to create a balanced look.</p>
	<p>While most of us are familiar with granite in its standard grey form, it can be quite surprising to see the full range of colours which are possible in this kind of stone. Every location where granite is mined produces stone with a colour which is completely unique to that area. Most granite, aside from the commonly known shades of grey, can be found in shades of pink, red, green, orange, yellow, and beige. Granite has a reputation for being one of the strongest and most dense stones used in interior design, making it one of the most useful.</p>
	<p>Granite is more than strong enough to create even the most ambitious interior architecture designs, and it is commonly used to craft staircases for grand buildings, both internally and externally. Granite can be used to create a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.ianknapper.com/stone-staircases/cantilever-curved-staircase/">cantilever staircase</a></strong></em></span> as the density of the stone allows it to effectively carry its own weight when anchored into a wall on one side.</p>
	<p>It is important to remember that while granite is one of the most popular stones to use in interior design, it is not the right choice for every space as it can sometimes look domineering and imposing. Its richly patterned surfaces can overwhelm a smaller room, making it feel cramped and much smaller and darker than it should. You can still make use of granite in smaller spaces, though the trick is to use it more sparingly.</p>
	<p>For example, you can use a striking granite trim to finish the edges of stone interior architecture made from a more plain material, or can try featuring it as a splashback in a kitchen without it looking like you have gone overboard. If you are determined to use strongly patterned stone such as granite in large quantities within a space, try to only use it in large spaces with plenty of natural light and high ceilings.</p>
	<p>Whichever kind of stone you choose, never simply choose one because you like the way it looks.&nbsp; Some stone varieties might look perfect in a high traffic area, only for you to discover that it was not strong enough to withstand heavy use and is starting to wear away. Always take the strength and hardiness of stone into consideration when choosing which kinds to use in your interiors.</p>
