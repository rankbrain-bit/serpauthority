	<h1>Virtual Cycling App</h1>
	<p>A fairly common complaint of endurance athletes that have been pushing themselves towards progress is that they eventually end up feeling like they have hit a wall. Not a literal one, of course, but what they experience is a seemingly impassible barrier keeping them from making any further progress during that session.</p>
	<p>Speak to any long distance runner or cyclist and most will tell you that it is one of the most frustrating challenges that dedicated athletes can face aside from physical injury. Experiencing the wall can be disheartening, but it is only temporary, as it is a side effect of giving it your all during a session.</p>
	<p>Health experts have long known what causes athletes to hit the wall - it is linked to a depletion of glycogen (the fuel your muscles use) in the blood stream. To help prevent themselves from reaching this point, you will often see athletes such as marathon runners and Tour de France cyclists snacking on glucose packs to top up their reserves during a race.</p>
	<p>This works in the short term, and really highlights the importance of correct nutrition for elite athletes in competition. Eating a balanced diet rich in healthy carbohydrates fuels the body for intense activity, helping you to go faster and further. As well as a carefully structured diet, athletes of all levels should also structure their workout sessions to enhance their performance over time.</p>
	<p>Competitive, professional athletes usually have the luxury of using personal trainers and sports coaches to train their bodies into peak condition, but most of us do not have the benefit of having world-class coaches at our disposal. Luckily, there are accessible and affordable alternatives available for those who want a truly effective workout regime.</p>
	<p>Joining a gym might seem like an obvious choice for those wanting to get in shape or maintain their fitness levels. As well as providing a safe place to use a range of equipment with professional supervision, most gyms offer a choice of coached classes such as spinning, HIIT, and yoga and more, so there is a strong chance you will find a class you love to accompany your wider workout efforts.</p>

	<p>Another option you might like to consider is exercising in the home on a treadmill or an exercise bike. To take your spinning to the next level, use a <a href="https://www.ciclozone.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>virtual cycling app</strong></em></span></a> with guided classes and live streamed sessions that get you in the zone. CicloZone have produced a full-service app with a vast library of classes which are perfect for cyclists of all levels of ability. In addition to these classes that can be accessed at any time, there are live streamed classes scheduled regularly which give that authentic, heart pumping spinning class atmosphere.</p>
	<p>Making use of such resources to support your training goes a long way to helping you level up your performance and push through the wall to the other side. Over time, your resting heart rate will decrease and your body will use oxygen and glycogen more efficiently to fuel your muscles during the most intense parts of your training sessions. By leveraging the science of heart rate zones, guided spinning classes put you through your paces and move you between the five heart rate zones.</p>
	<p>Zone 1 is the lowest level, involving the lightest exercise. In this zone your heart beats at 50% - 60% of its maximum heart rate and your pace should allow you to feel like you can continue for a long period&nbsp; of time without any discomfort and without getting out of breath.</p>
	<p>Zone 2 gets your heart beating at 60% - 70% of the maximum so is a little more intense than zone 1. Zone 3 is more intense still, but should still feel comfortable at 70% - 80% of your maximum heart rate. The cardio zone correlates to zone 4, which is where your heart really starts to work hard at 80% - 90% of its maximum beats.</p>
	<p>Zone 5 is the hardest of all the heart rate zones and your heart will be pumping at 90% - 100% of its maximum. This is the absolute upper limit of what your heart can do, and is strongly linked with your age. Even elite athletes cannot sustain zone 5 for more than a few minutes, as it is here that many encounter the wall and have to &lsquo;bonk out&rsquo;.</p>
