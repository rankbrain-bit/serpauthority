	<h1>Choosing Wooden Furniture for the Living Room</h1>
	<p>Whether you are moving into your first home or are upgrading or downsizing, the living room is one of the most important rooms to get set up early on. Moving house is hard work, so having somewhere to relax and forget about those remaining stacked boxes after a long day of unpacking can really make you feel more settled in.</p>
	<p>Living rooms of all kinds tend to follow a pretty similar formula; you will usually find comfy seating, entertainment systems, and some form of storage furniture. Living room furniture comes in a huge array of styles to suit all tastes, so you will have plenty of opportunities to create the perfect living space as you shop.</p>
	<p>Wood remains one of the most loved materials for furniture, especially in the living room where a warm and inviting feel is often the goal. The natural warmth of wood lends itself to most interior design styles, and there are options which suit every budget making it one of the most versatile materials for the home.</p>
	<h2>Choose your style</h2>
	<p>The style you want to achieve for your living room should be one that reflects the personality of the family, and should allow for it to be a practical space. Contemporary styles are often on the minimalist side, and the look is warmed up and made approachable by the inclusion of <a href="https://www.topfurniture.co.uk/living-room-oak-furniture.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>oak living room furniture</strong></em></span></a>. If you like clean lines and natural materials such as wood, linen and wool then a Scandi style living room might be the perfect choice. Scandi living rooms use natural colours and materials to form interesting textures and shapes in the living room.</p>
	<p>Classic living room styles which feature wood are also very popular, and create a very cosy, traditional look. Classic styles include country living rooms which make use of floral patterns and simple colour palettes, and more ornate styles. Classic living rooms are somewhat fussier than contemporary ones but are known for their charm and warmth.</p>

	<h2>Choose your furniture</h2>
	<p>As mentioned previously, most living rooms tend to include similar furniture. The living room is a space designed for relaxation, so comfortable couches and chairs should be a high priority. Ottomans are a great storage option as they double as footrests. If you have a TV then <a href="https://www.topfurniture.co.uk/oak-storage-furniture/oak-tv-units.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>TV units</strong></em></span></a> are a must, unless you prefer to use a wall mounted bracket. Having your TV mounted on the wall is a great idea in smaller living rooms where floor space is limited.</p>
	<p>If you have the space, bookcases add a lovely homely feel to living rooms, and give you quick access to all your favourites when you want to relax in the evening. Coffee tables are also a great place to keep a few choice titles from your book collection, and those with drawers are ideal for storing away any clutter.</p>
	<p>Before buying any furniture, measure your living room and think about what will fit in the space comfortably. Very large rooms can be divided into sections by placing the couch centrally rather than against a wall. Don&rsquo;t be tempted to buy tiny furniture for a small living room. Small furniture can make the room look even more cramped, so try to stick to a smaller number of full size pieces. You can find some fantastic deals at an <a href="https://www.topfurniture.co.uk/clearance-oak-furniture.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>oak furniture sale</strong></em></span></a> which is a great way to keep costs down.</p>
	<h2>Pick a colour scheme</h2>
	<p>You may already have a good idea of the colour scheme you want to use. In rented homes this can depend on how the home is decorated and whether the contract allows for redecoration or not. The modern trend in living room colours is to keep things light and fairly neutral. Neutral colours for walls and couches can be offset with accent pieces in stronger colours, but try to limit the number of colours to avoid clashes. Your chosen colour palette can completely transform the feel of your living room, so look for colours which are relaxing and you will be able to live with for a good while before redecorating. Beige, grey, cream, and pastel colours all work well, and look great with wooden furniture to give your living room a fresh yet relaxing look.</p>
