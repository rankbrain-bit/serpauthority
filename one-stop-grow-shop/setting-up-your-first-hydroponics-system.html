	<h1>Setting up Your First Hydroponics System</h1>
	<p>For home gardeners, few projects have the allure of hydroponics. A technical and modern way to produce crop plants, hydroponics is the preferred indoor gardening method for many amateur and professional growers. Many indoor gardeners start off with more traditional growing methods and then discover hydroponics along the way, while others choose this method out of necessity as they do not have access to an outdoor space to plant things.</p>
	<p>A rise in apartment living and a trend for small, low maintenance gardens means that people often don&rsquo;t have anywhere to grow plants outdoors, and so have sought out alternative methods which allow them to produce fresh, healthy plants within the home setting. Hydroponics systems are the solution that allows growers to make use of any space they have available, big or small, and almost guarantees superb results from every grow.</p>
	<p>Any good <a href="https://www.onestopgrowshop.co.uk/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>hydroponics shop</strong></em></span></a> will carry everything you could need to make a start on your first grow projects, and will always be happy to offer you the benefit of their knowledge and experience when it comes to indoor gardening. The specific kit you will need depends on the kind of crop you have decided to grow, so the best place to start is to research your chosen plant carefully so you have a good understanding of its needs.</p>
	<h2>Starter kits for indoor gardeners</h2>
	<p>Most beginner growers will start with something called a deep water culture system, or DWC. These are some of the most basic hydroponics systems you can use, and they are very easy to set up and maintain. They are a relatively low tech option, and the components tend to be very affordable at the entry level. Of course it is possible to choose an upgraded DWC system with enhanced features and capabilities, but a basic setup is more than adequate for most hobbyist growers.</p>
	<p>To start, you will want to figure out where your hydroponics system will be placed. If you have a suitable attic space then this can be a good idea as it tends to give you plenty of room while being out of the way of your daily home life. Most systems use <a href="https://www.onestopgrowshop.co.uk/t/categories/grow-lights/led-grow-lights"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>LED grow lights</strong></em></span></a> so you will need to make sure that wherever you place your system, there is an adequate power supply. Remember to never overload power outlets as this can cause a risk of fires.</p>
	<p>Lighting rigs need to be placed high enough so that the tops of adult plants are well lit without being burned, so mount the rig to the ceiling if possible. Basic light systems will produce a set amount of light so make sure your light system is big enough to handle the scale of your grow. Advanced lighting systems allow growers to control the intensity and colour of light, varying it throughout the growing season to simulate a plant&rsquo;s natural environment. This helps to increase yields, but the kit involved can be expensive.</p>
	<p>Hydroponics systems can be set up almost anywhere and are relatively compact for the amount of crop they are capable of producing. Having said this, the conditions in many homes are not optimal for plant growing as they can become too dry where central heating is used, and indoor temperatures might not be hot enough to stimulate strong plant growth, especially in the colder months. To ensure your plants always have optimal growing conditions you can use <a href="https://www.onestopgrowshop.co.uk/t/categories/grow-tents-and-sheeting/grow-tents"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>grow tents</strong></em></span></a> which are completely self contained. Tents keep in precious heat and moisture, or allow you to create any other environment for your plants as per their requirements. Controlling the environment of a relatively small and self contained unit is much easier than controlling that of an entire room, and so they are a very popular choice for novices and experienced growers alike.</p>
	<p>A hydroponics starter kit is highly recommended for your first projects. Try to keep things simple as you get used to the process as you can always upgrade parts of your system as and when you become more confident or feel you can change things up to increase your crop output. Kits tend to be a highly cost effective choice, giving you a great introduction to indoor gardening.</p>
