	<h1>Gift Giving Around the World</h1>
	<p>When it comes to cultural differences in gift giving, there are many strange and fascinating customs which must be followed. The act of gift giving is universal among humans, though the traditions associated with it are very different depending on where you are in the world. In fact, many cultures can have ideas around gift giving which conflict with those of other areas or countries, so it is always important to consider cultural differences when choosing a gift for someone.</p>
	<p>While it is one of humanity&rsquo;s oldest traditions, gift giving has evolved to mean very different things to different people and the ways we give gifts to friends and loved ones has changed a lot over the centuries. Navigating this often complicated world can be a challenge, so here are some of the most interesting and unique gift giving traditions from around the world.</p>
	<h2>India</h2>
	<p>India is one of the most populous countries in the world, and it is full of incredibly distinct and diverse cultures. There are many occasions that Indians love to celebrate, from personal events to public and religious holidays, and many come with their own traditional celebrations and gifts, as well as gift etiquette.</p>
	<p>For example, you should never give someone a gift with your left hand. In some cultures, including India, the left hand is associated with uncleanliness and therefore giving a gift to someone with your left hand can be insulting in India. This doesn&rsquo;t only extend to giving gifts or handing someone something in general, you also should not eat with your left hand either and should only pass things to other diners using your right hand.</p>
	<p>If you are giving cash as a gift, tradition dictates that you should only give it in odd numbers. Odd numbers are considered lucky by many Indians, and so giving someone a cash gift with an odd numbered value is a double gift as you are wishing them good fortune and good health too.</p>
	<h2>China</h2>
	<p>Manners and respect are highly valued in many Chinese cultures, and so this culture dictates how gifts should be given as well as the kinds of goods which make suitable gifts. One of the most well known Chinese gifting traditions is to give the gift of money in beautiful red envelopes. As well as being presented in the right kind of red envelope, all cash which is given as a gift should be new and clean, and notes should not be wrinkled or tatty at all. Try to avoid giving cash in a number which starts with 4, as this number is highly unlucky in Chinese culture. On the other hand, the number 8 is considered very lucky by many Chinese people, so amounts of cash which begin with 8 are considered lucky and are highly favoured.</p>
	<p>When receiving a gift, it is traditional for Chinese people to take it with both hands, and it should also be passed over to the recipient with both hands. If you are gifting a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.indiki.co.uk/">personalised box</a></strong></em></span> then you should hold it in front of yourself with both hands and wait for the recipient to take it with both of their hands. Using a single hand to give or receive a gift is usually considered polite, especially by traditionalists.</p>
	<h2>Italy</h2>
	<p>In this largely Catholic European country there are many fascinating traditions where gift giving is concerned. For example, did you know that Italians don&rsquo;t have a Santa Claus character in their culture? Instead parents tell their kids about a festive and benevolent witch called Befana who visits children on the Epiphany to deliver gifts. This means that most Italians don&rsquo;t celebrate Christmas Day with gifts like many Westerners do and instead save the gift giving for the Epiphany which takes place in January.</p>
	<h2>Germany</h2>
	<p>Germany is known for its interesting culture, and there are many ways in which it is different from other European countries and America. For example, in most countries most people can expect to be treated to a paid for dinner on their birthday, but in Germany it is traditional for the birthday person to pay for dinner for their friends and loved ones. It is their responsibility to organise their own birthday dinner, as well as provide everyone with drinks for the night.</p>
	<p>Another interesting birthday tradition from Germany states that if you are not going to see someone on their birthday, it is bad luck to give them their gift and card ahead of time. It is much better to wait until after the birthday has passed to give them their gift, even if it will be several days or even weeks later. In fact, it is seen as bad luck in Germany to celebrate anything prematurely for fear of jinxing your good luck.</p>
	<h2>Russia</h2>
	<p>Russia has an enduring flower language such as the one that was popular in the UK during the Victorian times. Every kind of flower has its own unique symbolism attached, so if you are gifting flowers to a Russian person you will need to do your research first to make sure the flowers you have selected are appropriate. All flowers must be given in odd numbers in Russian culture, as flowers are displayed in even numbers during funerals only.</p>
	<h2>United Kingdom</h2>
	<p>In the UK, gifting does have its own traditions, though in modern times only some of these tend to be observed with any regularity. One of the most traditional gifts given as a token or as part of a larger gift are scratch cards. These are usually given as birthday gifts, especially for young people turning 18. They are seen as more of a novelty gift than anything, though the recipient will always have the possibility of winning the jackpot.</p>
	<h2>Ireland</h2>
	<p>Giving gifts to friends and loved ones in Ireland comes with the tradition of refusing the gift a couple of times before finally accepting it. This is seen as polite, so don&rsquo;t be surprised if they decline your gift at first, you might have to attempt the handover a couple of times before they accept it!</p>
